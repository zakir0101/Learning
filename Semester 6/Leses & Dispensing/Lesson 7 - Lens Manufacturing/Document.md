**Introduction**

- More than 80 percent of all eyeglasses worn today have plastic lenses. Today, the manufacture of plastic eyeglass lenses far exceeds the manufacture of glass lenses, but the process has remained much the same for both types.
  
- Plastic as well as glass lenses are produced by successive stages of fine grinding, polishing, and shaping. While the same process is used to produce lenses for telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, cameras, and various projectors, such lenses are usually larger and thicker and require greater precision and power.

**Optical Laboratories**

- In the past, opticians relied on separate optical laboratories (Manual processing may be) to produce eyeglass lenses.

- Today, there are a number of full-service optical outlets that produce lenses for customers on-site.

- However, optical outlets do receive lens "blanks"—already formed to close-to-exact size with different curves ground into the front of the lens—from optical laboratories.

- Blanks with different curves are used for specific optical prescriptions.

**Material production**

- Mineral lens production begins with a blank lens. Natural raw materials (such as quartz, potassium carbonate, soda) are melted into a glass mixture at 1400 to 1500 degrees temperature.

- Next, they are processed into a round glass block 1 to 3 cm thick – the so-called blank. It is a sort of uncut lens blank.

The front face is treated in the following production step: A diamond-grinding tool gives it the exactly defined surface shape and final touch. The required transparency is achieved through polishing. A blank that is ground on the front side is thus created.

**Surfacing layouts**

- The optical laboratory technician inputs the optical prescription for a pair of lenses in the laboratory's computer. The computer then provides a printout specifying more information necessary for producing the required prescription.

- Based on this information, the technician selects the appropriate lens blanks. Each blank is placed in a prescription tray which will remain with the technician throughout the production process.

- Although the appropriate curves have already been ground into the front of the lens, the technician must still grind curves into the back of the lens. This is done in a curve generator.

**Steps of Surfacing**

- Today machines are able to process up to 120 lenses per hour with the precision and accuracy of a computer-run machine.

- The technician places the lenses in a lensometer, to locate and mark the "optical center"—the point that should be centered over the lens blanks.

- Next, adhesive tape is affixed to the front of each blank to keep the front from being scratched during the "blocking" process.

- **Blocking:** After going through the taping process, an alloy block is next affixed to the front surface of the lens.

- **Generating:** Having had an alloy block affixed to it, the lens is then on its way to the generator where it will begin the cutting process.

- **Polishing:** After being cut on the generator, it is necessary for the lens to be polished. During this step, polish the back of the lens to give it a smooth and even surface.

- **De-blocking:** After going through all the preceding steps, it is time for the lens to be removed from the alloy block that was applied to it earlier in the lens surfacing process.

- **Tape Removal:** After removal from the alloy block, it is time for the lens to have its protective tape removed.

- Visually checking lenses for scratches, chips, rough edges, or other blemishes; visually checking the optical prescription before the lenses are viewed in the lensometer, and verifying optics while the lenses are in the lensometer.
