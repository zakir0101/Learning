The Median from the frequency
distribution table :-

The Median = A + <sup>∑F</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> – f<sub>1</sub> X L
                 f<sub>2</sub> – f<sub>1</sub>
Example:-
Find the Median from This table :-

| Classes (C) | Frequency (f) |
|---|---|
| 60 – 69 | 4 |
| 70 – 79 | 2 |
| 80 – 89 | 5 |
| 90 – 99 | 6 |
| 100 – 109 | 3 |
| Sum | 20 |

The Solve:- 
M=A+ <sup>∑F</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> – f<sub>1</sub> X L
        f<sub>2</sub> – f<sub>1</sub>
<sup>∑F</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> = <sup>20</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> = 10

The last lecture, we studied the arithmetic mean from frequency table. Today, we want to study the median from frequency table and the mode from frequency table. We begin with the median from frequency table. Okay.

The law. The median equals A plus summation F divide 2 minus F1 divided F2 minus F1 times L.

We want know, uh, A means what's means A? And what's mean summation F divided 2? And what's means F1 and F2 and L?

We know that L means the length of class. طول الفئه
F1: frequency before, F2: frequency after summation F. Summation F divided summation F summation summation F means summation for frequency مجموع التكرارات 
A: The beginning of frequency.
Okay, we see the example. Example: Find the median from frequency table. This frequency table: 60, the classes, 60 to 69. Okay? 70 to 79, 80 to 89, 90 to 99, 100 to 109. Frequency 4, 2, 5, 6, 3. Summation of frequency, 20. Okay.

طيب هنا عندنا الجدول موجود عايزين نشوف الوسيط كيف نطلعه من الجدول التكراري.
Here, we have the present table. We want to see how the median comes out of the frequency table. We write the formula first, and we knew we must have A, which is the start of the median class, summation F, which is the sum of frequencies, F1 is the previous frequency of the median class, and F2 is the following frequency of the median class, and L is the length of the class. The length of the class, we know it is upper minus lower. The upper minus mean class upper minus lower class. Okay? This this table or frequency table, the solves see page number one. M equals A plus summation F divided 2 minus F1 divided F2 minus F1 times L. 
We calculate summation F divided 2. Summation F is 20 divided 2, 20 divided 2 equals 10. We go to the next page, page number two.

| C | f | Upper C | F.C.A |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60 – 69 | 4 | 69 < | 4 |
| 70 – 79 | 2 | 79 < | 6 |
| 80 – 89 | 5 | 89 < | 11 |
| 90 – 99 | 6 | 99 < | 17 |
| 100 – 109 | 3 | 109 < | 20 |
| ∑ | 20 | – | – |


∑F/2= 10, A=79, L=9
f1=6, f2=11

∴ M=79+10-6/11-6x9
    =79+4/5x9
    =86.2

∴ The Median= 86.2

**Audio Transcription:**

Page number two, we know C, class, F frequency, upper C, the upper C, the F.C.A. Okay?
Here there are 60 to 69, frequency is 4. 70 to 79, frequency is 2. 80 to 89, frequency is 5. 90 to 99, frequency is 6. 100 to 109, frequency is 3. Summation of frequency is 20.
Summation of frequency divided by 2 is equal to 10. A is equal to 79, L is equal to 9, f1 is equal to 6, f2 is equal to 11.

Therefore, M is equal to 79 plus 10 minus 6 divided by 11 minus 6 times 9. This equals 79 plus 4 divided by 5 times 9 equals 86.2.
Therefore, The Median is equal to 86.2.

Less than 69, less than 69 the frequency, less than 69 four. Number four, frequency four.
Here we say less than 79, less than 79. Less than 79, frequency 2, we add 4 plus 2, which is 6.
Then we add the frequency 6 to the next one, which will be 6. Less than 89, it's 11 plus 6, which is equal to 17.

So here we have all frequencies so we can apply to the formula, Summation of F equals 20. Important things is that we have to know the beginning of median class, Summation of F divided 2 equals 10.
Go to the column number four and find where the number 10 is. It is between 6 and 11.  Between 6 and 11, we have a line pointing to the class of the median. So 79 is the beginning class of the median. Therefore we get A, we get f1 and we get f2. 
We can get L by subtracting 60 from 69 or 70 from 79 which is equal to 9.
The summation of frequency is 20. So summation f divided by 2 is equal to 10.

~ The Mode from frequency table :-
Example :-
Find The Mode from This Table :

| C | f | M |
|---|---|---|
| 10 – 14 | 3 | 12 |
| 15 – 19 | 4 | 17 |
| 20 – 24 | 7 | 22 |
| 25 – 29 | 2 | 27 |
| 30 – 34 | 4 | 32 |
| Sum | 20 |  |

Mode = A+  f<sub>2</sub> X L
              f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub>

The Ans :-
A = 20 , L = 4 , f<sub>1</sub>= 4 , f<sub>2</sub> = 2

∴ Mode = 20 + <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>4+2</sub> X4
          = 20 + <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> X 4
          ≈ 21.333

∴ Mode = 22

**Audio Transcription:**

Okay. Page number three.
The mode from frequency table.
Example: Find the mode from this table.
C, f, m. C: 10 to 14, 15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34. Frequency: 3, 4, 7, 2, 4. The Sum: 20.
Midpoints: 12, 17, 22, 27, 32.

Mode is equal to A plus f2 divided by f1 plus f2 times L.
The Answer: A equals 20, L equals 4, f1 equals 4, f2 equals 2.

Therefore, mode equals 20 plus 2 over 4 plus 2 times 4 which equals 20 plus 4 over 6 times 4 which is approximately 21.333.
Therefore, mode is equal to 22.

We know how to find the midpoints. The first class midpoint: 10 plus 14 divided by 2 equals 12.
The next class: 15 plus 19 divided by 2 equals 17.
20 plus 24 divided by 2 equals 22.
25 plus 29 divided by 2 equals 27.
30 plus 34 divided by 2 equals 32.
We complete our table.

The formula is written below. We are looking for A. A is the beginning of the modal class. The largest frequency in column two is 7. The largest frequency is drawn as an arrow to midpoint and to the class. Therefore the beginning of the class which is 20 to 24 is equal to 20, therefore A equals 20. Seven, the midpoint which corresponds to it is 22. So, when we calculate using the formula, the value will be close to 22.
f1, frequency is 4 and f2 is also 2.
A equals 20, we will not use 22 since we'll confirm whether the final value will be equal to 22 or close to it after using the formula.

Now we will apply the formula. Mode equals 20 plus 2 over 4 plus 2 times 4, which is 20 plus 4 over 6 times 4 equals 21.333. This means it is close to 22. We round it to the nearest whole number, which is 22.

So, we'll be able to confirm if we got the correct answer. So when solving for mode in the exam, make sure that your answer is close to 22. It does not have to be the exact same value, but close to it with one decimal point which can be rounded to the nearest integer.
We apply the formula, mode equals 20 plus 2 over 4 plus 2 times 4. This is equal to 20 plus 4 over 6 times 4 which gives us 21.333. Here the mode is close to 22 which is correct.

We want to calculate the arithmetic mean from the frequency table. How to calculate the mid of class?
We have the mid of class: lower limit plus upper limit divided 2.

The first class: 2 to 4, frequency 4.
2 to 4: 2 plus 4 divided by 2 equals 3.
4 to 6, frequency 6.
4 plus 6 divided by 2 equals 5.
6 to 8, frequency 5.
6 plus 8 divided by 2 equals 7.
8 to 10, frequency 8.
8 plus 10 divided by 2 equals 9.
10 to 12, frequency 7.
10 plus 12 divided by 2 equals 11.
Summation f: 30.

X is equal to summation of mid times frequency divided summation f. X is equal to 226 divided by 30. That is equal to 7.5333. The mean is approximately 7.5.
We already have the classes and frequencies. The most important thing is that we add column three and column four, we have the m times f. m times f: 4 times 3 = 12, 6 times 5 equals 30, 5 times 7 equals 35, 8 times 9 equals 72, 7 times 11 equals 77.
Summation m.f equals 226.

Now apply the law, the arithmetic mean, its symbol is x-bar. x-bar equals summation mid times f divided by summation f.
226 over 30. That equals 7.5333 approximately 7.5.

Page number 4, the solve. We want to calculate the tally. Okay. Here we'll calculate the tally to get the ascending frequency table, after that, we'll be able to create the ascending frequency table.

The problem the students face in the frequency table is finding the ascending frequency or how to create the ascending frequency table. It is very simple. We'll focus now.
We know that the classes are 60 to 69, frequency is 4.
We look at the third column. We're filling the ascending frequencies, less than 69 is 4. The next frequency less than 79 is 2. So less than 79 is 4 plus 2 is equal to 6. The next class, 90 to 99, frequency 6, so less than 99, is 17 + 3 which is equal to 20.

So we've filled all frequencies in the ascending order. Then we will be able to use the formula. Summation of frequencies is equal to 20. The most important thing is to find the beginning of the median class. Summation f divided by 2 is equal to 10. 
Going down in the ascending frequency table F.C.A, where does 10 lie? Between 6 and 11. We draw a line to find which is the median class. The value before the line, f1 is equal to 6, while the value on the line f2 is equal to 11.
L, the length, is equal to 69 minus 60, or 79 minus 70 which is equal to 9.
