# Lens Manufacturing: A Detailed Overview

## Introduction

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and with His help, we begin our seventh lecture in Dispensing Two. This lecture will cover lens manufacturing and surfacing.  More than 80% of eyeglasses worn today use plastic lenses. While glass was predominantly used in the past, plastic has become more popular due to its safety advantages. Glass is breakable and can cause eye injuries, making plastic a safer alternative.  The production of plastic lenses now significantly surpasses that of glass lenses. Although the manufacturing processes for both materials are similar, involving mixing, grinding, polishing, and shaping, there are subtle differences. Plastic and glass lenses are produced through stages of fine grinding, polishing, and shaping.

## Lens Manufacturing for Other Optical Devices

The same basic process is used for lenses in telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, cameras, and projectors. These lenses are typically larger, thicker, and demand higher precision and power, leading to greater manufacturing complexity and cost.  This discussion specifically focuses on eyeglass lenses, not lenses for other optical devices.

## Optical Laboratories: Then and Now

In the past, opticians relied on separate optical laboratories, often using manual processes to produce eyeglass lenses, which was a time-consuming process.  Modern optical labs employ automated, computerized machinery. Today, full-service optical outlets often produce lenses on-site for their customers. Some facilities are large-scale manufacturers, while others utilize smaller, in-house equipment to serve their clientele directly.

## Lens Blanks and Surfacing

Optical outlets receive lens blanks—thick, circular discs—which are then surfaced to achieve the required prescription. The front surface is often pre-finished.  The surfacing process shapes the back surface to create the desired power.  Different curves on the blank are utilized for various optical prescriptions to optimize lens form.  A plus one (+1.00) lens, for example, would not have the same curve as a plus twelve (+12.00) lens.

## Material Production and Blank Creation

Lens material production starts with the blank.  Raw materials, including quartz, potassium carbonate, and soda (sand, potassium, carbon, and soda), are melted together at extremely high temperatures (1400-1500°C). The molten mixture is then pressed into round glass blocks, 1-3 cm thick, forming the uncut lens blank or "blank".  The front surface is typically finished at this stage using a diamond grinding tool to achieve the precise shape.  Polishing then creates the necessary transparency.  The back surface is subsequently processed to create the final prescription.

## Lens Surfacing and Layout

### Layout Requirements

The process begins with the technician inputting the prescription into the laboratory's computer. The computer then generates a printout with detailed information for lens production. This information guides the technician in selecting the appropriate lens blank based on parameters like front surface power, diameter, and thickness.  The computer prompts the technician with questions to ensure the correct blank is chosen.  Each blank is then placed in a prescription tray.

### Back Surface Grinding

While the front surface is usually pre-ground, the technician grinds the back surface using a curve generator.

### Steps in Surfacing

Modern machines can process up to 120 lenses per hour with computer-controlled precision. The technician uses a lensometer to locate and mark the optical center of the lens.
