# Dispensing 2: Progressive Lenses

### Recap of Previous Lecture

- Introduction to Multifocal Lenses
- Bifocal Lenses
- Trifocal Lenses

### Progressive Lenses: The Modern Approach

- Progressive lenses represent the latest technology in multifocal lenses and are widely used globally.
- They are gradually replacing bifocals and trifocals, which are now seeing limited use.
- Progressive lenses resemble single vision lenses in appearance, contributing to their wider acceptance.
- Advantages:
    - Cosmetically appealing
    - Easy to adapt to
    - Provide a better visual experience

### Understanding Progressive Lenses

- Smooth Transition:  Progressive lenses offer a seamless transition from distance correction to near correction, eliminating the abrupt changes found in bifocals and trifocals.  This smooth transition minimizes visual disturbances like blurriness and distortion that can occur with segmented lenses.
- Eliminating Segmentation Lines:  Progressive lenses lack the visible lines present in bifocals and trifocals, offering clearer vision at all distances, including intermediate ranges.
- Early Development and Key Players:
    - Varilux and Zeiss were among the pioneering companies in the development of progressive lenses.
    - The initial designs emerged around 1972, but significant advancements were limited by the manufacturing technology of the time.
- Technological Advancements:  The development of advanced manufacturing technologies, including computer-aided design, has led to more sophisticated and comfortable progressive lens designs.

### Progressive Lens Design and Fitting

- **Progressive Lens Diagram (referencing a provided PDF)**
    - Upper Portion: Clear, unsegmented area for distance vision correction.
    - Middle Portion: Progressive zone for intermediate vision.
    - Peripheral Areas:  Areas with unwanted cylinder or astigmatism, potentially causing distortion. The "corridor" or progressive channel between the distance and near viewing areas is initially narrow in design but has been widened over time with newer generations of lenses. Companies continue to refine designs to minimize these peripheral distortions.
- Importance of Fitting: Accurate fitting is crucial for optimal performance of progressive lenses. The "fitting point" (marked by a cross) needs to be precisely aligned with the center of the pupil.  Incorrect fitting can lead to several issues:
    - Narrowed field of view
    - Clear vision in only one eye
    - The need to adjust head position to see clearly

### Specialized Progressive Lenses

- Computer Use: Some progressive lenses are specifically designed for computer use with a wider intermediate zone.
- Reading: Other designs offer a wider reading portion for those who spend significant time reading.
- Marking and Finishing: After fitting, markings on the lens are removed for a natural appearance.

### Advantages of Progressive Lenses

- Natural Correction: Progressive lenses provide a more natural visual experience compared to bifocals or trifocals, making it feel as if the wearer doesn't have presbyopia.  This natural vision is due to the smooth transition between distance, intermediate, and near vision zones.
- Elimination of Image Jump: The seamless transition eliminates the "image jump" experienced with bifocals, where the image appears to shift abruptly when the wearer's gaze moves between the different segments.
- Continuous Improvement: Progressive lens designs are constantly being refined to reduce peripheral distortion and improve overall comfort. Modern progressive lenses allow most first-time wearers to adapt almost immediately, unlike the adjustment period often needed for bifocals.

### General Problems and Contraindications for Multifocal Lenses (including Progressives, Bifocals, and Trifocals)

- Vertigo: Multifocal lenses can exacerbate vertigo or dizziness.
- Working at Heights:  Multifocal lenses can pose safety risks for those working at heights due to potential misjudgment of distances.
- Significant Anisometropia:  Large differences in refractive error (more than 1.5 diopters) between the two eyes can make fitting multifocal lenses challenging.  (Up to 1.5 diopters may be manageable).
- High Degrees of Oblique Astigmatism:  Significant oblique astigmatism can also create difficulties with multifocal lenses, although smaller amounts (e.g., 0.75 or 1 diopter) may be less problematic.
