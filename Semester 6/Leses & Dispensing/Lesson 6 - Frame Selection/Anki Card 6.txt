Basic;What is the primary focus of Lecture Six in Dispensing 2?;Answer: The primary focus of Lecture Six in Dispensing 2 is <b>Frame Selection</b>, which involves assisting patients or customers in choosing the right eyeglass frames based on various factors such as face shape, coloring, and frame measurements.
Basic;Why is it impractical for customers to try on every pair of eyeglasses in a store?;Answer: It is impractical because trying on every pair of eyeglasses is time-consuming and tiring. Instead, determining the customer's face shape and coloring can significantly streamline the selection process.
Basic;What are the two main factors to determine when selecting the appropriate eyeglass frames for a customer?;Answer: The two main factors are the customer's <b>face shape</b> and <b>coloring</b>. These factors help in choosing the frame styles and colors that will best enhance the customer's appearance.
Basic;What is Pupillary Distance (PD) and why is it important in frame selection?;Answer: Pupillary Distance (PD) is the measurement of the distance between the centers of the pupils of the eyes. It is important because it determines the proper lens shape and alignment of the prescription to the line of vision, ensuring visual comfort and preventing decentration.
Basic;What are the two types of Pupillary Distance measurements and their specific uses?;Answer: The two types of PD measurements are:<ol><li><b>Distance PD</b>: Used for general use and distance vision prescriptions.</li><li><b>Near PD</b>: Specifically used for reading glasses and near work.</li></ol>
Basic;Describe the method of measuring PD using corneal reflection.;Answer: Measuring PD using corneal reflection involves using a <b>corneal reflection pupillometer (CRP)</b> to measure the distance from the pupil, utilizing the light reflected from the cornea, to the center of the nose where the frame bridge rests. This measurement is called <b>monocular PD</b> and is taken for each eye individually before adding them together to obtain the full <b>binocular PD</b>.
Basic;What is the typical range of binocular PD for adults and children?;Answer: For adults, the binocular PD typically ranges from <b>54 mm to 76 mm</b>, while for children, it ranges from <b>41 mm to 55 mm</b>.
Basic;When are monocular PD measurements most often used?;Answer: Monocular PD measurements are most often used when the face is not perfectly symmetrical, meaning one eye is closer or farther from the middle of the face than the other.
Basic;What are the key frame measurements that need to be considered during frame selection?;Answer: The key frame measurements are:<ol><li><b>Eye Size (Lens Size)</b>: Ranges from <b>40 mm to 62 mm</b>.</li><li><b>Bridge Size</b>: Ranges from <b>14 mm to 24 mm</b>.</li><li><b>Temple Size (Arm Length)</b>: Ranges from <b>120 mm to 150 mm</b>.</li></ol>
Basic;What are the main principles of frame selection?;Answer: The main principles of frame selection include:<ol><li><b>Contrast Face Shape</b>: Frames should contrast with facial contours rather than mimic them.</li><li><b>Balance Proportions</b>: Frames should bring symmetry and balance to prominent features.</li><li><b>Proper Size</b>: Frames should be proportionate to the face size.</li><li><b>Comfort and Fit</b>: Frames should fit well without causing discomfort.</li></ol>
Basic;How should frames be selected for a person with a round face?;Answer: For a round face, <b>square or rectangular frames</b> should be selected to make the face appear longer and add balance to the round features. <b>Rimless frames, round frames, and small frames</b> should be avoided as they can exaggerate the roundness of the face.
Basic;What frame styles are recommended for an oval face shape?;Answer: Most frame shapes suit an oval face. It's best to select frames that are not too deep or too narrow. <b>Overly large frames</b> that cover more than half of the face should be avoided to maintain the natural balance and symmetry.
Basic;Which frame shapes should be avoided for a square face?;Answer: For a square face, <b>angular and boxy eyeglass frames</b> should be avoided as they will emphasize the squareness and angular features of the face.
Basic;What are the recommended frame styles for a diamond face shape?;Answer: For a diamond face shape, which is the rarest, it is recommended to use <b>frames with detailing or distinctive brow lines</b>, <b>rimless frames</b>, or <b>oval shapes</b>. <b>Boxy and narrow frames</b> should be avoided as they draw attention to the narrow features.
Basic;How should frame color be selected based on a person's coloring?;Answer: Frame color should complement the individual's personal coloring, which is generally categorized as <b>cool (blue-based)</b> or <b>warm (yellow-based)</b>. For cool coloring, frames in shades like <b>black, silver, blue, gray, and dark tortoise</b> are best. For warm coloring, frames in colors such as <b>brown, gold, honey, beige, olive green, and light tortoise</b> are suitable. Skin tone is the primary element in determining the appropriate frame color.
Basic;What is the purpose of matching frame shapes with face shapes?;Answer: The purpose of matching frame shapes with face shapes is to create contrast and balance, enhancing the patient's appearance by highlighting desirable features and minimizing less desirable ones.
Basic;What factors should be considered when selecting frame styles, especially for women?;Answer: When selecting frame styles, especially for women, factors to consider include:<ol><li><b>Material</b>: Such as plastic, metal, or combinations affecting weight and appearance.</li><li><b>Design Elements</b>: Decorative features, color patterns, and unique shapes.</li><li><b>Trends and Fashion</b>: Current styles that may appeal to the patient.</li><li><b>Functionality</b>: Durability and suitability for the patient's lifestyle.</li></ol>
Basic;Why is skin tone considered the prime element in color analysis for frame selection?;Answer: Skin tone is considered the prime element because it is the primary factor in determining whether a person's coloring is cool or warm, which in turn influences which frame colors will best complement their overall appearance.
Basic;What should be avoided when selecting frame colors for individuals with darker skin tones?;Answer: For individuals with darker skin tones, <b>white frames</b> should be avoided as the high contrast can be jarring and draw unwanted attention to the glasses. Instead, colors like <b>browns, blacks, and similar hues</b> are more suitable.
Basic;How does frame size relate to Pupillary Distance (PD)?;Answer: Frame size relates to PD in that frames should align properly with the line of vision based on the PD measurement. A wide interpupillary distance typically requires larger frames, while a narrow PD requires smaller frames to ensure the lenses are correctly positioned over the eyes.
Basic;What is the binocular PD range for adults and how does it differ from children's PD range?;Answer: The binocular PD range for adults is <b>54 mm to 76 mm</b>, whereas for children, it ranges from <b>41 mm to 55 mm</b>. Adults generally have a wider PD compared to children.
Basic;What is the limbus-to-limbus method for measuring PD and when is it appropriate to use?;Answer: The limbus-to-limbus method involves measuring from the lateral limbus of the right eye to the medial limbus of the left eye. It provides a good approximation of the PD and is appropriate to use when the eyes are symmetrical.
Basic;Why is it important to consider facial asymmetry when measuring PD?;Answer: Considering facial asymmetry is important because if one eye is closer or farther from the middle of the face than the other, monocular PD measurements ensure that each lens is correctly centered over each eye, enhancing visual comfort and accuracy.
Basic;What is the recommended range for temple size in frame measurements?;Answer: The recommended range for temple size (arm length) in frame measurements is <b>120 mm to 150 mm</b>.
Basic;How does frame selection enhance the patient's appearance?;Answer: Frame selection enhances the patient's appearance by choosing frames that contrast with facial contours, balance proportions, and complement the individual's coloring, thereby highlighting desirable features and minimizing less desirable ones.
Basic;What role does color analysis play in frame selection?;Answer: Color analysis plays a role in frame selection by ensuring that the frame colors complement the patient's personal coloring, including skin tone, eye color, and hair color, which enhances their overall appearance and ensures the eyewear is aesthetically pleasing.
Basic;What should be avoided when selecting frames for an oval face shape?;Answer: When selecting frames for an oval face shape, <b>overly large frames</b> that cover more than half of the face should be avoided as they can disrupt the natural balance and symmetry of the face.
Basic;How can understanding frame measurements contribute to better frame selection?;Answer: Understanding frame measurements ensures that the selected frames fit comfortably and align properly with the patient's eyes, providing both visual clarity and aesthetic appeal.
Basic;What are the characteristics of a triangular face, and which frame shape is most suitable?;Answer: A triangular face is characterized by a narrow forehead that widens at the cheek and chin areas. <b>Rectangular frames</b> are most suitable as they add width to the narrow upper face, balancing the overall appearance.
Basic;Why is it important for frames to contrast with facial contours rather than mimic them?;Answer: It is important for frames to contrast with facial contours to create balance and symmetry, enhancing the patient's natural features instead of exaggerating or emphasizing any particular aspect of the face.
Basic;What are the recommended frame colors for individuals with cool coloring?;Answer: For individuals with cool coloring, recommended frame colors include <b>black, silver, blue, gray, and dark tortoise</b>.
Basic;How does monocular PD measurement ensure proper lens alignment?;Answer: Monocular PD measurement ensures proper lens alignment by measuring each eye individually from the pupil to the center of the nose bridge, accounting for any facial asymmetry and ensuring that each lens is correctly centered over each eye.
Basic;What is the function of a corneal reflection pupillometer (CRP) in PD measurement?;Answer: A corneal reflection pupillometer (CRP) functions to measure PD more accurately by using the reflection of light on the cornea to determine the distance from each pupil to the center of the nose bridge, providing precise monocular PD measurements.
Basic;What should be considered regarding frame style when selecting eyeglasses for a patient?;Answer: When considering frame style, factors such as <b>material</b>, <b>design elements</b>, <b>current trends and fashion</b>, and <b>functionality</b> should be taken into account to ensure the frames are both aesthetically pleasing and suitable for the patient's lifestyle.
