# Dispensing II: Lecture 3 - Multifocal Lenses

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and with His help, we begin. Today, we will discuss our third lecture in Dispensing II.  Our topic is multifocal lenses.  Previously, we focused mainly on single vision lenses.  In our initial Dispensing II lectures, we discussed eye protection and lens tinting in general. Today, however, we delve into a new type of lens: the multifocal lens. Multifocal lenses are very important because they address an age-related condition that affects everyone: presbyopia. Everyone, at some point in life, inevitably experiences presbyopia.  Those who live past forty will experience presbyopia. Therefore, accommodation must be corrected, typically with lenses. Presbyopia, as we mentioned, begins after the age of forty. You've already learned about this in Refraction, so we won't spend too much time on it. It's characterized by difficulty reading, needing brighter light, or holding objects at arm's length to see them. Patients will express difficulty reading, prompting a visit to optometry or ophthalmology clinics, resulting in a prescription for glasses.

These glasses can sometimes be two separate pairs if the patient already has existing refractive errors for distance vision. This requires separate glasses for distance and reading, which can be quite inconvenient.  This led experts in the field to develop multifocal lenses.  These have evolved significantly over time, reaching a high level of development, which we will discuss in our next lecture.


## What are Multifocal Lenses?

Multifocal lenses contain two or more lens powers to help see objects at all distances after losing the ability to naturally change focus due to age-related presbyopia. They have two or more powers:

- Power for distance
- Power for reading
- Possibly a power for intermediate distance
- Some can be progressive, gradually changing power from distance to reading. This is the newer type known as progressive lenses, which we will discuss later.

## Types of Multifocal Lenses

Let's look at the types of multifocal lenses:

* **Bifocals:** Contain two lens powers, one for distance and one for near vision.

* **Trifocals:** Contain three powers; one each for distance, intermediate, and near vision. The name "trifocal" derives from the Latin word for "three".

* **Progressive Multifocal Lenses:** These gradually change in power from the top half of the lens to the bottom, making them the most modern option.  Progressive means the power is gradual from the top to the bottom part of the lens, allowing comfortable vision at all distances, not just distance, intermediate, and near.

## Bifocals for Children?

In some cases, bifocals are prescribed for children. This might seem surprising, as they are typically associated with presbyopia. However, they address specific binocularity problems, sometimes monocularity problems. These prescriptions can be for:

* **Binocular Vision Issues**: Problems with accommodation and convergence.

* **Monocularity Issues**: Loss of accommodation, perhaps due to cataract surgery.  This could be due to loss or excess accommodation.

* **Loss of Accommodation**: An implanted lens necessitates correction.

* **Excess Accommodation**:  This is seen in children with strabismus, often worsening when looking at near objects (convergence excess).  In these cases, bifocals help alleviate the focusing effort for near vision.

In such cases, the bottom portion of the bifocal lens reduces the focusing effort required to see near objects clearly.  If you look at the provided PDF, you can see the bifocal shape: the top portion is for distance and the bottom for near.  The trifocal is divided into three: distance at the top, intermediate in the middle, and near at the bottom.

## Segment Shapes

Let's discuss the types of segments, which are the shapes of the reading portions of the lens:

The lens segment can take several shapes:

1. **Half-Moon / D-Shaped / Flat Top:**  These are three names for the same basic, rounded shape.

2. **Narrow Rectangular Area**: A small rectangular segment, typically used for the intermediate portion of a trifocal lens, known as a ribbon segment.

3. **Full Bottom Half:** The entire bottom half of the lens is for reading, in contrast to a smaller designated segment. This is known as executive, E-style, or Franklin style, named after Benjamin Franklin, who is credited with the early development of bifocals.

Generally, the wearer looks through the distance portion of the lens when focusing on a distant point and looks down through the bifocal segment when focusing on reading material or objects within forty centimeters of the eyes.  This is the purpose of the segments: distance vision in the upper part and near vision in the lower segment when looking down, providing comfortable reading up to 40 cm.

## Trifocal Details

The trifocal lens has three points, or segments, of focus: usually for distance, intermediate, and near vision.  The intermediate segment sits directly above the near segment and is used to view objects at arm's length.  This covers distances between 40 cm and 1 meter.  You can see in the PDF, a D28 lens (28mm diameter), a D35 (35mm diameter, D-shaped), an executive style (bisected), a round 24mm diameter lens, and another round 38mm lens. The dimensions are shown, indicating how they are laid out.  "R" signifies the right eye; it's important to distinguish between right and left. The diagram shows the 5mm height from the center for the D-shaped segment, a 10mm thickness/depth, and a 28mm diameter.

## Bifocal History and Construction

Bifocal lenses have been around since the late 18th century. Benjamin Franklin, in a very simple approach, cut his distance and reading glasses in half, then combined the top half of the distance lens with the bottom half of the reading lens, creating the first bifocals. This sparked the concept of bifocals, solving his problem and that of countless others. Although this method was rudimentary, it has since evolved considerably. Bifocals were popular for a time, but have declined since the introduction of progressive lenses.  

Modern bifocals are still made of two parts, and come in solid and fused versions:

* **Solid Bifocals**: Made of a single material but with different curvatures for the distance and reading portions, separated by a visible line.  This can be problematic as the visible line can collect dirt and require extra cleaning. It's also cosmetically less appealing.

* **Fused Bifocals**: Use two materials with the same curvature.  The distance portion uses a material with a lower refractive index, and a small button of higher refractive index material is fused into the lens for the reading portion. This eliminates the visible line, making it smoother and more cosmetically appealing.

Bifocals do not account for the intermediate zone. This makes it difficult to view things like a computer screen while wearing bifocals.  Computer screens are typically beyond 40 cm, posing a challenge for bifocal wearers for intermediate tasks, such as reading a phone screen.  However, they are sufficient for traditional reading from books. The image shows the historical Franklin bifocal. The bifocal types illustrate the solid bifocal with its curvature difference, and the fused bifocal with its integrated segment.

## Trifocal History and Usage

John Isaac Hawkins, in 1827, developed eyeglasses with three regions correcting for distance, intermediate (arm's length), and near vision. He essentially built upon the bifocal concept and expanded it into the trifocal, using the same underlying principles and methods. Trifocals are mostly used by people with advanced presbyopia who require a reading addition of two diopters or more.  Those with a reading addition less than two diopters (e.g., +1.75, +1.50, +1.00) usually don't have problems with intermediate vision because they still have sufficient accommodation.  However, a stronger addition impacts intermediate vision, making trifocals necessary, especially for tasks like computer work or reading electricity meters, where intermediate vision is crucial.  The style of the trifocal is the same as the bifocal but with the added intermediate segment.

Importantly, the intermediate addition is normally half of the reading addition. So, if the reading addition is +2.00, the intermediate is +1.00; if the reading is +3.00, the intermediate is +1.50; if the reading is +4.00, the intermediate is +2.00; if the reading is +1.50, the intermediate is +0.75.

## Fitting Bifocals and Trifocals

There are slight differences in fitting bifocals versus trifocals.

* **Bifocal Fitting**: Bifocals are typically placed so the top line of the segment rests at the same height as the wearer's lower eyelid.  This positioning ensures that when the eyes drop down to read, they naturally find the near vision portion of the lens.

* **Trifocal Fitting**: Trifocals are fitted a bit higher, prioritizing the intermediate zone. The top line of the intermediate segment is placed even with the lower margin of the pupil. This allows the wearer to utilize all three zones effectively. The trifocal wearer looks through the intermediate zone when viewing something between 40 cm and 60 cm away.

With this, we conclude our lecture on bifocal and trifocal lenses. In the next lecture, we will discuss progressive lenses. Until we meet again, may God's peace be with you.
