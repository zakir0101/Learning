**In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and with Him we seek help.**

### Introduction

- Students, today we begin our second lecture in Dispensing.
- This lecture was initially planned to be presented as a video with accompanying audio.
- Due to personal circumstances and potential network/upload issues, the lecture will be delivered as an audio recording.
- The accompanying PDF will be sent to you separately. Please open the PDF and listen to the audio simultaneously.

### Review of Dispensing Lecture 1

- In the previous lecture, we discussed:
    - Lenses
    - Measuring lens power using different methods
    - Transposition
    - Lens types

### Introduction to Dispensing Lecture 2

- Today, we will discuss lens properties and their relationship to frames, completing the Dispensing material.  We'll start by talking about eye protection.

### Eye Protection: An Overview

- Eye protection, or "eye pro," focuses on protecting the eyes.
- Beyond correcting refractive errors, eye protection guards against harmful radiation.  This is particularly important in modern life due to increased exposure to:
    - Gases
    - Manufacturing byproducts
    - Reflections

- These factors can all cause eye damage. This lecture will explore how we address these hazards using lenses.

### Sources of Eye Damage: Radiation

- First, let's examine the sources of harm, and then we'll discuss how to mitigate them.

#### Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation and Infrared (IR) Radiation

- We'll begin with ultraviolet (UV) light and infrared (IR) light. These are present in solar radiation. You'll find diagrams in the PDF.
- Solar radiation refers to the sun's radiation reaching Earth.
- Much of this radiation reaches us directly, while some is blocked. We'll examine this further.
- The amount of radiation reaching the Earth's surface varies based on:
    - Time of day (morning, noon, evening)
    - Atmospheric conditions (clouds, rain)
    - The ozone layer
    - Water vapor
    - Dust/particulates in the atmosphere

These factors influence the presence of both UV and IR radiation.

#### UV Radiation Breakdown

- UV radiation is categorized into three types:
    - UVA: Longest wavelength
    - UVB: Medium wavelength
    - UVC: Shortest wavelength

- Wavelengths are measured in nanometers (nm).  One millimeter equals 1000 nanometers.

#### UVC and the Ozone Layer

- Radiation shorter than 288 nm, particularly UVC, is absorbed by nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, creating the ozone layer.
- This is crucial because UVC radiation is harmful.
- The ozone layer absorbs a significant amount of this radiation, protecting us.

#### Near Infrared Radiation

- Near-infrared radiation (NIR), with wavelengths between 780 nm and 1400 nm, reaches the Earth in large quantities.
- NIR gives us the sensation of heat.
- Longer IR wavelengths (above 1400nm, up to 1mm) are mostly absorbed by the atmosphere.

### Natural Eye Protection

- The eye has natural defenses against radiation, beginning with the cornea.

#### Cornea

- The cornea absorbs nearly all radiation below 300 nm.  This is critical because radiation penetrating further into the eye could damage the crystalline lens and retina.  The cornea's ability to absorb this radiation is a remarkable design feature.

#### UV Radiation Types and Their Effects

- UVA: 315-400 nm
- UVB: 290-315 nm
- UVC: < 290 nm, and down to 100nm
- UVC is not part of the solar spectrum reaching the Earth's surface, as it's absorbed by the ozone layer.

#### UVB and Corneal Damage

- Studies have shown corneal damage from UV radiation, specifically in the 220-310 nm range, which falls within the UVB spectrum.
- UVB has the highest energy of all solar radiation reaching Earth.  Shorter wavelengths have higher energy.
- UVB is strongly reflected by snow, significantly increasing exposure and potential damage, a condition known as snow blindness or photokeratitis (corneal inflammation).  This explains why people in snowy regions often wear protective eyewear.
- Prolonged, high-level UVB exposure can cause corneal damage.
- Additionally, thereâ€™s a strong link between UV exposure and pterygium, and other corneal inflammations.

#### Crystalline Lens

- The crystalline lens acts as a second line of defense, absorbing most UV radiation below 400 nm. It filters out what the cornea misses. This protects the retina from UV radiation transmitted by the cornea.
- Studies on animals have linked radiation exposure to cataract development.
-  The prevalence of cataracts in Sudan, especially among agricultural workers exposed to sunlight, highlights this risk.  The cataracts develop at a much younger age (40-45) compared to the typical onset after 60-65 years. This is due to cumulative UV exposure from a young age.
- Prolonged UVB exposure has been linked to cortical cataracts, one type of cataract among many.  You've studied cataract types in ophthalmology courses.  Chronic UVA exposure is *not* associated with cataract development. So, while UVA is part of the non-visible spectrum, it doesn't appear harmful. UVB is the primary culprit.

#### Retina

- When the crystalline lens is removed (e.g., cataract surgery), both UVA and UVB radiation can reach the retina.
- This can lead to retinal damage.
- Studies show that the incidence of cystoid macular degeneration after cataract surgery can be reduced with UV-blocking intraocular lenses (IOLs).  This degeneration can occur even years after surgery and lens implantation, impacting detailed vision.  This is often due to continued UV exposure without protection.

#### Modern Lens Technology

- Modern IOLs offer UV protection, shielding the retina from both UVA and UVB.
- Older IOLs, and especially afakia (absence of a lens), require additional protection with tinted glasses or contact lenses with UV blockers.  Individuals who have had afakia can sometimes perceive UV radiation around 365 nm (UVA) as violet due to the eye's chromatic aberration. This can reduce image contrast.

#### UV Protection Recommendations

- UV protection is essential in all cases.  People who've had afakia, especially, must wear tinted glasses or UV-blocking contact lenses. Sunglasses are also recommended.

### Effects of Infrared (IR) Radiation

- Now that we've covered UV light, let's examine infrared (IR) radiation.

#### IR Radiation Characteristics

- Although IR radiation reaches the Earth's surface in large amounts, its energy is lower than UV radiation because IR has longer wavelengths.
- Even when reflected into the eye from trees or grass, IR radiation is not generally harmful.
- Direct eye damage from IR has been documented in industrial settings with long-term, high-level exposure.  Studies show increased levels of cataracts in glass, iron, and steel workers compared to control groups.  These workers are particularly exposed to large amounts of IR radiation.

#### IR Protection

- When IR protection is necessary, the best materials are gold, aluminum, silver, copper, and chromium-nickel alloys.  These coatings reflect large amounts of incident radiation.  These are often added to lenses.  They are used in goggles worn in industrial settings to prevent IR-related eye damage.
- Dark green sunglasses also absorb IR radiation.
- Plastic lenses, generally, do not provide IR protection without adding these specific materials.

### Effects of Blue Light

- IR radiation is responsible for the feeling of heat. When exposed to the sun, it's primarily IR that causes the burning sensation.
- UV radiation, specifically UVB, can cause sunburn, premature aging (skin wrinkling), and skin cancers.
- Blue light has also been implicated in retinal damage, a particular concern for industrial workers with chronic exposure.  This is because blue light has shorter wavelengths and therefore higher energy.  This is why blue-blocking glasses are becoming more common.
- Natural blue light from the sun does not typically require special protection unless directly gazing at the sun, which can cause photochemical damage to the retina due to blue light.
- Chronic blue light exposure from the sun may be related to the development of age-related maculopathy and other eye diseases. This condition typically affects older adults and can impair reading and detail vision, often resulting from cumulative exposure to sunlight without protection. Blue light may also contribute to the progression of retinitis pigmentosa.
- Standard gray sunglass lenses reduce blue light levels, and photogray lenses are becoming increasingly popular and effective in blocking these potentially harmful rays.

### Conclusion

This concludes our lecture for today. We will continue in the next lecture, focusing on specific methods of eye protection. Thank you.
