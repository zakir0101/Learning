Frame style

• When a person visit an optician, his/her prescription covers 
all the details a dispensing optician will require in producing 
the lenses for the glasses.

• But both the style and size of the frame depend upon 
his/her own personal choice.

• If he/she already wear spectacles, then may be able to find 
the dimensions of the frame printed on them. 

• This would normally be on the inside of one of the arms. 
• These are three distinct sets of numbers: the first represents the longest dimension of the lens, the second is 
the distance between the lenses, and the third is the side 
length of the arm from the temple to the tip.

Boxing system

• In 1962 was adopted the 
boxing system to provide a 
standard for frame and lens 
measurement that improved 
the accuracy of previous 
systems.

• The boxing system is based 
upon the idea of drawing an 
imaginary box around a lens 
shape.

• The sides of the boxes used as 
reference points for the 
standard system of 
measurements.

Basic Boxing Measurements

• "A" Measurement - The horizontal distance between 
the furthest temporal and nasal edges of the lens 
shape or the distance between the vertical sides of the 
box. The A measurement is also commonly known as 
the eye size.

• "B" Measurement – The vertical distance between the 
furthest top and bottom edges of the lens shape or the 
distance between the horizontal sides of the box.

• Distance Between Lenses (DBL) – The shortest distance 
between the nasal edges of each lens or the distance 
between boxes. DBL is also commonly referred to as 
bridge size.

Secondary Measurements

• Datum Line – The horizontal line that runs through the 
vertical center of the frame.

• Geometric Center (GC) – The intersection of the Datum 
Line and horizontal centers of each lens shape.

• Distance Between Centers (DBC) – The horizontal 
distance between the geometric centers of the lenses. 

• DBC is also know as the Geometric Center Distance 
(GCD), but previously referred to as the frame PD. In 
theory the DBC can be calculated by adding the "A" 
Measurement to the DBL as marked on the frame, 
however in practice the calculation may differ from the 
actual measurement.

Effective Diameter (ED)

• Effective Diameter (ED) – Twice the distance from 
the geometric center of the lens furthest edge of 
the lens shape. 

• The ED can also be defined as the smallest 
diameter lens that would cutout.

• If the frame's geometric center matched the 
lenses optical center. ED is used in combination 
with decentration distance to select the minimum 
lens blank size required to fit a given frame.

Frame Marking Conventions 

• Standardized frame markings look like this: 52 □20. 
That is, there are two numbers separated by the box 
symbol. 

• This marks  indicates that frame measured according to 
the Boxing System. 

• In such a frame, the first number will be the A-
dimension. The second, on the other side of the box, 
will be the DBL.

• However, the DBC (frame PD) is the sum of the A-
dimension and the DBL. Therefore, by adding the two 
numbers in the frame marking you can quickly figure 
out the DBC.
