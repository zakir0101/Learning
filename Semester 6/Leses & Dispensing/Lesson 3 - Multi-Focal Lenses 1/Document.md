**Presbyopia**
- Usually after the age of 40, a person will begin to notice the symptoms of presbyopia, including the feeling that arms "aren't long enough" to hold a newspaper or magazine at a position where they can read it clearly.
- If a person already wears spectacles, this generally means they may need to begin wearing multifocal lenses to continue seeing clearly at all distances.
- Multifocal lenses contain two or more lens powers to help see objects at all distances after losing the ability to naturally change focus due to age (presbyopia).

**Types of Multifocals**
- Bifocals contain two lens powers; trifocals contain three. Progressive multifocal lenses gradually change in power from the top half of the lens to the bottom, containing many lens powers.
- However, in some cases, bifocals are prescribed for children and young adults with focusing problems (loss or excess of accommodation). 
- In these cases, the bottom portion of the bifocal lens reduces the amount of focusing effort required to see near objects clearly.

**Types of segments**  
The lens segment (or "seg") can be one of several shapes:  
1. A half-moon, also called a flat-top, straight-top, or D segment, and a round segment.  
2. A narrow rectangular area, known as a ribbon segment.  
3. The full bottom half of a bifocal lens, called the Franklin, Executive, or E style.

Generally, users look through the distance portion of the lens when focusing on distant objects, and look down through the bifocal segment when focusing on reading material or objects within 40 cm of their eyes.

Trifocals have three points of focus: usually for distance, intermediate, and near vision. The intermediate segment is directly above the near “seg” and is used to view objects at arm's length.

**Bifocals**  
- Bifocal lenses have been around since the late 18th century and were created when Benjamin Franklin cut two lenses in half (each with different corrective powers) and glued them together.  
- Modern bifocal lenses are still made up of two parts.  
1. Solid or single material and difference in curvatures, with the two sections of the lens separated by a visible line.  
2. Fused form, where the segment of the lens can also be fused from a material of higher index into the original lens material (smooth line and no difference in curvature).

- Bifocal lenses do not account for the intermediate zone of vision, making it difficult to view things like a computer screen while wearing them.

**Trifocals**  
- John Isaac Hawkins developed eyeglasses in 1827 with three regions that correct for distance, intermediate (arm's length), and near vision.  
- Trifocals are mostly used by people with advanced presbyopia who have been prescribed 2.0 diopters or more of reading addition.  
- Trifocal lenses are made in similar styles to bifocals, but with an additional segment for intermediate vision above the reading section.  
- The intermediate addition is normally half the reading addition.  
- Larger intermediate segments are available, particularly useful for people who use computers.

**Bifocals and Trifocals Fitting**
- Bifocals are typically placed so the line rests at the same height as the wearer's lower eyelid.  
- As a bifocal wearer drops their eyes downward to read, the eyes naturally seek out the near-vision portion of the lens.  
- Trifocals are fitted a bit higher, with the top line of the intermediate “seg” placed even with the lower margin of the pupil.  
- A trifocal wearer looks through the intermediate zone when viewing something between 40 cm and 60 cm away.
