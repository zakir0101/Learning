**Frame Selection**

- You can try on every pair of eyeglasses in the store to find out how each one looks.
- But simply need to determine the face shape and coloring and understand which eyeglass frame styles and colors would look best on the face.
- The most important aspect of choosing eyeglass frames is how they look on the face.
- Pupillary distance is an important measure used to determine the proper lens shape and alignment of prescription to the line of vision.

**Pupillary Distance (PD)**

- The PD is measured with a millimeter rule. The resulting measurement is called the binocular PD.
- A more accurate method of measurement recommended today is corneal reflection.
- It involves measuring the distance from the pupil, using light reflected from the cornea, to the center of the nose where the center of the frame bridge rests. This measurement is called the monocular PD.
- The instrument used to measure the corneal reflection is called the corneal reflection pupillometer (also known as CRP).

- Generally, adults have PD within the range of 54-68 mm, while children have PD within the range of 41-55 mm.
- The binocular measurement (pupil-to-pupil measurement) will be between 41-80 mm.
- The monocular measurement (which is a per-eye from the pupil to the middle of the face) will be between 20-40 mm.
- Monocular measurements are most often used when the face is not perfectly symmetrical, meaning one eye is closer or farther from the middle of the face than the other.

**Frame Measurements**

- The Eye Size (eye piece) of frames ranges from 40 to 62 mm.
- The Bridge Size of frames ranges from 14 to 24 mm.
- The Temple Size ranges from 120 to 150 mm.

**Principals of Frame Selection**

- The key to finding the right frames is to select eyeglasses that contrast from the facial contours and bring symmetry and balance to the prominent features.
- Is the face round, oval, square, diamond, or heart-shaped? The shape of the face will help to determine which frames enhance the customerâ€™s look.
- The other factors that determine the best frame color are the colors of the skin, eyes, and hair.

**Face Shape**

- Round Face: Square or rectangular frames tend to make it appear longer, adding balance to the round features.  
  Frames to Avoid: Rimless frames, round frames, and small frames make the round face look even rounder.

- Oval Face: An oval face is considered to be the ideal shape because of its balanced proportions. Select frames that are not too deep or too narrow.  
  Frames to Avoid: Overlarge frames that cover up more than half of the face will throw off the natural balance and symmetry of the oval face.

- Square Face: Oval or round eyeglasses will balance and add a thinner appearance to the angles of a square face.  
  Frames to Avoid: Angular and boxy eyeglass frames will draw attention to the angular features.

- Diamond Face: This is the rarest face shape. Try frames that have detailing or distinctive brow lines, or try rimless frames or oval shapes.  
  Frames to Avoid: Boxy and narrow frames will draw attention to the narrow features.

- Rectangular Faces: Oval and round frames would be most suitable with medium or larger size models.

- Triangular Faces: Rectangular frames would be most suitable.

**Color Analysis**

- Most people have either cool (blue-based) or warm (yellow-based) coloring.
- Everyone looks best in his or her own color base.
- Eyewear color should complement personal coloring.
- Olive skin is considered cool because it is a mixture of blue and yellow.
- Skin tone is the prime element in determining coloring.
