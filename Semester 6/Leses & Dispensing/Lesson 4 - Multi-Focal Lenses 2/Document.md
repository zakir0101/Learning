Progressive lenses

• Progressive spectacle lenses, also called progressive  
addition lenses (PAL), progressive power lenses,  
graduated prescription lenses, and varifocal or  
multifocal lenses.

• Progressive lenses provide a smooth transition from  
distance correction to near correction, eliminating  
segment lines and allowing clear vision at all  
distances, including intermediate.

• The Varilux and Zeiss lenses were the first PAL of  
modern design. The breakthrough for the adaptation  
and the comfort of the progressive lens occurred in  
1972 with the market introduction of Varilux 2.

Progressive Design

Fitting

• Progressive lenses require careful placement  
relative to the wearer's pupil centre for a  
distance-viewing reference position.

• Incorrect fitting can cause problems for the  
wearer including: narrow fields of view, clear  
vision in one eye only, and the need to alter the  
natural head position in order to see clearly.

• Some progressive lenses are made specially for  
computer use, for example, and have a wider  
intermediate zone. Other progressive lens  
designs may have a larger reading portion.

Advantages of Progressive Lenses

• In addition to cosmetic advantages, progressive  
multifocal lenses provide a more natural  
correction than bifocal or trifocal.

• And progressive lenses eliminate an annoying  
problem caused by bifocal and trifocal lenses  
known as "image jump."

• progressive lens designs have been continually  
improved to reduce peripheral aberrations.  
Today, most first-time wearers are comfortable  
with progressive lenses almost immediately.
