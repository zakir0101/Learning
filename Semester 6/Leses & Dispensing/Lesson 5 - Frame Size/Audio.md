# Lecture 5: Dispensing II - Frame Size Measurement

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, we begin today's lecture, number five, in Dispensing II. We will discuss frame size and how to measure it.

## Frame Size and Style

We'll examine frame style and the process involved when a person visits an optician.

When a person visits an optician, their prescription covers all the necessary details the dispensing optician requires to produce the lenses. Optometrists or ophthalmologists typically write the prescription for the glasses.  However, the optician is responsible for selecting the frame and adapting it for the patient to wear.

Both the style and size of the frame depend on the individual's personal preferences.  We cannot dictate to the customer which frame color or shape they should wear. We will discuss general guidelines for frame selection in the next lecture. Ultimately, the choice is personal.

If the person already wears glasses, they might find frame dimensions printed on them.  Experienced eyeglass wearers might already know these dimensions, as they're usually printed on the frame's arm. We will examine what these measurements represent and their meanings.

These dimensions are usually found on the inside of one of the arms of the frame, as seen in the image below.

(Imagine an image of the inside of a frame arm with dimensions printed on it)

These dimensions consist of three distinct sets of numbers.

1. **A-Measurement:** Represents the longest horizontal dimension of the lens, or the distance between the vertical sides of the "boxing system" we'll discuss shortly.

2. **Bridge Distance:** Represents the distance between the two lenses, the space that sits on the bridge of the nose.

3. **Side Length (Temple Length):** Represents the length of the temple/arm of the glasses.

## Boxing System

We'll now discuss the "boxing system," the most common and globally recognized method for measuring frame size. The term "boxing" refers to a box, not a building.

This system was adopted around 1962 to provide a standard for frame and lens measurements, improving the accuracy of previous systems like the "datum system."  The boxing system involves creating a rectangular box around the lens shape, drawing tangent lines to the four furthest points of the lens.  The intersection of the diagonals of this box represents the geometrical center of the lens.

(Imagine an image illustrating the boxing system around a lens)

The sides of this box serve as reference points.  The lines of the box, both vertical and horizontal, become our references for the measurements.

## Basic Boxing Measurements

1. **A-Measurement:** The horizontal distance between the furthest temporal and nasal edges of the lens, effectively the width of the lens within the boxing system. This is the first measurement typically printed on the frame arm.

2. **B-Measurement:** The vertical distance between the top and bottom edges of the lens, effectively the height of the lens within the boxing system. This measurement isn’t usually printed on the frame.

3. **Distance Between Lenses (DBL):** The shortest distance between the nasal edge of each lens, or the distance between the boxes if drawn for both lenses.  This measurement is also known as the bridge size and corresponds to the second number printed on the frame arm.

(Imagine a labeled diagram illustrating the A-measurement, B-measurement, and DBL)

An image showcasing frame size would include the lens width, bridge size, frame width, and frame height.

## Secondary Measurement: Datum Line

A secondary measurement is the datum line.  This horizontal line passes through the vertical center of each frame (lens).

(Imagine an image illustrating the datum line)

The datum line connects the geometrical centers of the right and left lenses, extending to the edges of the lenses and frame.  This was the older system, but it's not as precise as the boxing system.

### Geometrical Center and Distance Between Centers (DBC)

The geometrical center is the intersection of the datum line and the horizontal center of each lens. The horizontal distance between the geometrical centers of the two lenses is known as the Distance Between Centers (DBC), also referred to as the geometrical center distance (GCD).  Previously, this was called the frame PD (pupillary distance), though the frame itself doesn't have a PD; the term was used metaphorically. The preferred term is now geometrical center distance or distance between centers.

Theoretically, the DBC can be calculated by adding the A-measurement to the DBL, as marked on the frame. However, in practice, this calculation might differ slightly from the actual measurement.


To visualize this, return to the initial drawing of the boxing system. The geometrical center lies precisely in the middle of the box, not the lens itself. Since we're working with the box, it's divided into two equal parts (temporal and nasal). The DBL is a constant distance.  Therefore, adding one lens width (A-measurement) plus the DBL will theoretically give the same result as measuring directly between the two geometrical centers.

## Effective Diameter (ED)

The effective diameter is twice the distance from the geometrical center of the lens to its furthest edge.  Lens shapes can be irregular. To find the ED, identify the geometrical center and the furthest point on the lens edge. Some areas of the lens will be closer to the geometrical center, while others will be further away. The largest distance from the geometrical center to any point on the lens edge is half the effective diameter; multiply this by two to obtain the ED.

We multiply by two to determine the required lens blank diameter. This is crucial for cost-effectiveness. A large diameter increases cost, while a small diameter might be too small to cut the lens from.

If the frame's geometrical center aligns with the lens's optical center, the effective diameter, combined with the decentration distance (if any), helps select the minimum lens blank size needed for a given frame.

For example, if the effective diameter is 30mm, the required lens blank diameter is ideally around 60mm. A small amount will be removed during fitting.

If decentration is required to address issues like heterophoria, convergence, accommodation, or any other binocular vision problem, the decentration distance needs to be added.  For instance, if a 4mm decentration is necessary, the required lens blank diameter becomes 64mm (60mm + 4mm). This is the principle behind using the effective diameter.

## Frame Marking Convention

As mentioned, standard frame markings typically look like this: "52 □ 20," found on the arm of the frame.

These two numbers are separated by the box symbol (□). This marking indicates that the frame is measured according to the boxing system. If a dash (-) is used instead of a box, it indicates the older datum system.

In this example:

* **52:** Represents the A-dimension (lens width).
* **20:** Represents the distance between lenses (DBL or bridge size).

The distance between centers (DBC or frame PD) is the sum of the A-dimension and the DBL.  In this case, it would be 52 + 20 = 72.  Therefore, by adding these two numbers on the frame marking, you can quickly determine the distance between centers.

We will conclude here for today.  We will meet again, God willing, in another lecture.
