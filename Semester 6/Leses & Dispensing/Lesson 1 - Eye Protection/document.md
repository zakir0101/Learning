**Ultra violet (UV) & Infra red (IR)**

The amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface of the earth varies with a large number of factors including time of day, cloud cover, and the amount of ozone, water vapor, and dust in the atmosphere.

The shortest wavelength that reaches the surface of the earth is UV radiation of wavelength 288 nm. Shorter than 288 nm are absorbed by molecules of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere (to create ozone layer).

The near IR radiation from 780 to 1400 nm reaches the surface of the earth in large amounts, but longer wavelengths (1400 nm to 1 mm) are heavily absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere.

**Cornea**

The cornea absorbs all radiation below approximately 300 nm, with transmittance increasing rapidly above this wavelength.

UVA (315 - 400 nm), UVB (290 - 315 nm), and UVC (290 - 100 nm are not part of the solar spectrum absorbed by ozone).

Studies have shown that corneal damage from UV radiation extends from approximately 220 to 310 nm.

The UVB has the highest energy of all radiation that reaches the surface of the earth from the Sun. UVB radiation is strongly reflected by snow, greatly increasing the levels reaching the eye.

Corneal damage caused by a few hours' exposure to high levels of UVB is termed snowblindness or photokeratitis. Pterygia and keratopathy have been associated with long-term solar UV exposure.

**Lens**

The crystalline lens absorbs most UV radiation below 400 nm, acting as a filter that protects the retina from most UV radiation that is transmitted by the cornea.

Radiation that reaches the lens has been implicated in the development of cataracts. Animal studies indicate that acute exposures to UV radiation from 295 to 320 nm (primarily UVB) causes lens opacities.

More recently, epidemiologic studies suggest that chronic UVB radiation exposure is associated with the development of cortical cataracts, but not nuclear cataracts, and that chronic UVA exposure is not associated with the development of cataracts.

**Retina**

When the crystalline lens is removed, both UVB and UVA radiation reach the retina. Animal studies suggest that this radiation has little effect on retinal damage.

The incidence of cystoid macular degeneration after cataract surgery can be reduced with the use of UV-protective intraocular lenses.

UV radiation as short as 365 nm can be detected by the aphakic patient and appears violet. Because of the chromatic aberration of the eye, this radiation is out of focus and decreases image contrast.

It is highly recommended that all intraocular lenses provide protection against UV radiation, and all aphakic patients should have complete UV protection in their spectacles, contact lenses, and sunglasses.

**Effect of Infra-Red (IR)**

Although it reaches the surface of the earth in large amounts, solar IR radiation is of low energy relative to UV radiation, and the IR reaching the eye either directly or by reflection from trees and grass is not harmful.

Direct ocular damage from IR radiation has been documented for long-term relatively high-level exposures in industry. Studies showed that glass, iron, and steel workers had increased levels of aging cataracts relative to control groups.

When protection from IR radiation is desirable, the best protection is provided by gold, aluminum, silver, copper, and chromium-nickel alloy coatings that reflect large amounts of incident radiation.

Dark green glass sunglasses absorb IR radiation. Plastic lens materials generally do not provide IR protection.

**Effects of Blue light**

IR radiation is responsible for the feeling of heat when the skin is exposed to the Sun. But the effects of UV radiation on the skin include sunburn, aging, and skin cancers.

Blue light has been implicated in damage to the retina, and this damage is of most concern for industrial workers who have chronic exposure.

Blue light from natural daylight does not reach the eye in high enough levels to require special protection, although the retinal damage that occurs with Sun gazing is attributed primarily to photochemical damage from blue light.

However, chronic exposure to blue light from the sun may be related to the development of age-related maculopathy and other eye diseases, and possibly to the progression of retinitis pigmentosa.

A standard gray sunglass lens reduces the level of blue light that reaches the retina by approximately 80%.
